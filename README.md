(More) Historically Accurate Europa Universalis 4

A mod that used to be a collaboration and composition of other mods to make the experience of Europa Universalis more interesting and historically accurate.

Today the mod is called More Historically Accurate Europa Universalis or MHAEU for short.
||
This mod tries to make the vanilla definition of EU more historically accurate and interesting, still trying to be true to the Vanilla experience.
